        <h2>Pre<p>RED</p></h2>
        <p>Before I welcomed RED into my life I would binge-work.. a lot. I was building cell phone towers in order to fund my trips and hobbies. Rock climbing has always taken precedence but I have recently grown quite fond of skiing.</p>

    <h2>Travel Adventure</h2>
    <p>It was late and the road was wet. We were driving for hours in a<br>foreign land of Slovenia. Looking for somewhere to call home for the night.<br>Instead of receiving directions from the first (and only) people we found, we received wine and great food.<br>We were welcomed to join in with the celebration of harvest and enjoyed the rest of the night to<br>as it become a blur of music and new friends.</p>
