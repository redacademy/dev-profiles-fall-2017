        <h2> Where I'm from </h2>
        <p class="sidebar"> I grew up in Ottawa. I have lived in beautiful Pemberton for the past 
            year. Prior to that 
            I lived in Calgary. I am a huge lover of outdoor fun. I am 
            passionate about a bunch of activities, so take a look below for 
            some fun pics of what I like to get up to in my free time.</p>

        <h2> Why I'm here </h2>
        <p class="sidebar"> I was a professional chef for the last few years. I have
             had the opportunity to travel to many interesting places persuing this career.
              After a ton of reflection, I came to the realization that I would be
               much happier following another life-long passion: computers! I have 
               dabbled in coding before, but have never though of it as a career 
               path.
        </p>
        <p class="sidebar">     
               One interesting fact about me: I am a coach on Pembertons (and soon Vancouvers) Gracie Jiu Jitsu team. I instruct kids and adults on the gentle art of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
              My coolest travel experience was spending a year in the British Virgin Islands as a private chef.
             My secret talent is cooking shawarma, a favorite meal of Ottawa ex-pats.
            After I graduate, I hope to one day work remotely in exotic locales all over the world. </p>
