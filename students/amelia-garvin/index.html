<h1>Hi!Bonjour! My name is Amelia Garvin</h1>

<img src="http://www.renaissancekids.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Amelia1200x1600.jpg" alt="image of amelia" style="width=100px;height=100px;">

<h2>Where am I from?</h2>

<p>My hometown is all over the Fraser Valley in British Columbia. I grew up on a vegetable farm in Surrey for some time
as well as in a place named Aldergrove. I moved to Vancouver in 2009 to pursue a Bachelor's of Fine Art at Emily CArr University and now live on South Granville!</p>
<h3>What was I doing before deciding to learn at Red Academy?</h3>
<p>I was an art teacher at a private school in Richmond. I am also a small business owner as I work as a freelance graphic designer, illustrator and painter.
As in a lot of cases, pictures speak louder than words so I thought we could visit my portfolio together.This is my second time taking a course at Red Academy. Last Fall I took a part-time UX design course and hope to use what I learned in that course during my full-time studies.
<a href="http://cargocollective.com/ameliagarvin"> Let's go to my website!</a></p>
<br>
<p>One of my goals in this course will be to create a new website for myself that I can use to propel my art business. 
My ideal site would include:
<br>
<ul class="goals">
	<li>E-commerce functionality</li>
	<li>Social media links</li>
	<li>Landing page</li>
	<li>Blog</li>
</u>

<h3>An interesting fact about me</h3>
<p> I am a triplet! </p>
<br>
<h3>My best travel experience</h3>
<p> My best travel experience was a trip to Tofino in 2014. I surfed, fell asleep on the beach, saw whales, traversed an island with new friends and drank beer. It was glorious.</p>
<br>
<h3>My goals upon finishing the web development program at Red Academy</h3>
<p>Upon graduation, My goal is to work as a junior web developer. I would like to expand my teaching repertoire to include coding, web development and graphic design.</p>
