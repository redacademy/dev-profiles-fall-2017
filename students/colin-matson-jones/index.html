            <h2>Hometown</h2>
              <p> I was born in East Vancouver, just a few blocks east of commercial drive. When I was 10,
          my family moved to Coquitlam, and I went to High School in Port Coquitlam. If you don't know Port Coquitlam,
          a fun fact is that Canada's worst serial killer is from there! 
              </p>

        <div id="Pre-RED">
            <h2>Pre RED?</h2>
              <p>For the past 6 years I had been pursuing a career in music. I received my diploma in Contemporary and Jazz guitar
            from VCC in 2013, and I spent a year working as a lead guitarist for Carnival Cruise Lines where I completed 2 
            runs of the Western Caribbean. For the past year and a half I have been playing guitar professionally in Vancouver
            and teaching guitar both privately and as a contracted teacher for several different music schools. Something I didn't 
            realize was that pursuing music as a source of income would have me almost exclusively playing cover music and background
            music-two things I don't love. I've also realized I don't love teaching guitar. And then one day at a family dinner I hear
            that my brother has enrolled in a digital marketing course at a school called RED Academy...

          <h2>Best Travel Experience</h2>
            <p>Since I've yet to do the whole <em>"go backpacking alone and find yourself quest"</em>, I'd have to say that my 
            best travel experience was when I worked on cruise ships. I got to see some really beautiful places in the Caribbean
            with some great friends. My favourite places were Cozumel and Aruba.

          <h2>Post RED</h2>
            <p> Well, like most of us I imagine, I would like to be working in the tech sector after RED. There seems to be
            endless opportunity in this field and it's really exciting, and I love the idea of working somewhere abroad
            or even working remotely and travelling! There are several companies that I've had my eye on a little bit:
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Hootsuite (this one in particular!)</li>
                <li>Spotify</li>
                <li>Xmatters</li>
                <li>Mobify</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <br /> <br />
      
        <p>It feels crazy that this is finally happening! I'm really excited to develop my skills and get going at RED, I've 
        heard so many great things and I can't wait to start this new chapter in my life.
