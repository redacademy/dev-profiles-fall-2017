          <h3>Life Before RED</h3>
              <p>Hometown: Vineland, ON</p>
              <p>Before I enrolled at RED Academy I had just completed my masters degree in Public Administration at Queen's University in Kingston, ON. </p>
          <h3>Hidden Talent</h3>
              <p>I'd like to think I'm a pretty good cook.</p>
          <h3>Best Travel Experience</h3>
              <p>In the middle of my undergrad I took a semester off to teach English in Southern Nepal. It was a great opportunity to experience a lifestyle very different from that in Canada.</p>
          <h3>Big Plans</h3>
              <p>After RED I hope to be able to bridge what I've learnt here with my previous academic assets. The longterm plan would be to open a business of my own.</p>
