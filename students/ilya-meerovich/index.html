	<h2>Hometown </h2>
	<p>I was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, but I grew up right here in Van. </p>


	<h2>Before RED </h2>
	<p> Prior to making the decision to come to RED, I taught ESL in an after school program. </p>


	<h2>Travel Experience</h2>
	<p>I was really lucky to be able to teach English in Shandong Province, China. This was a UBC internship that lasted for 8 months. I had a great time, met some very interesting people from different parts of the world, and got to eat some things that are very hard to come by in Vancouver. </p>


	<h2>Secret Talent</h2>
	<p>I wasn't a big fan of high school math and I used that time to learn some pen spinning tricks.</p>


	<h2>Future Goals</h2>
	<p>In the future, I would like to work as part of a development agency. There are some absolutely stunning websites on the Internet and I want to build more. I don't know the first thing about freelancing, so working as part of a team is a better fit for me.</p>


	<h2>Fun Fact</h2>
	<p>I speak English, Russian, Mandarin, and a smattering of HTML. </p>
