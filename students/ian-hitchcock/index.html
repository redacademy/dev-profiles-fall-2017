                        <h3>Riding a Camel in the Sahara Desert</h3>
                        <p>As part of our trip visiting Morocco, my girlfriend and I had the experience of riding Camels into the Sahara Desert to camp for one night. A Sahara sunset and sunrise combined with the thrill of riding camels through the sand dunes made this one of the best experiences of our lives!</p>

                        <h3>Watching Argentina play in the 2014 World Cup</h3>
                        <p>This was especially amazing as my brother and I had great seats to watch Messi score the game winning goal versus Bosnia.</p>

                <h2>Hometown</h2>
                <p>I was born and raised in Victoria, BC. If you ever visit I recommend trying out one of the many amazing brunch restaurants; my favourite is The Blue Fox Cafe, but Jam and Floyd's Diner are good options too! I have also lived in Montreal breifly and now call Vancouver home!</p>
