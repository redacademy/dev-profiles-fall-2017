			<h2>All about my life</h2>
			<p>I grew up in Calgary AB, and that was pretty cool. Then I moved to Vancouver where I lived for a bit, then Montreal for a stint, and now I'm back in Vancouver BC. I went to the University of British Columbia, where I majored in Geography, and I was most recently working in a bicycle repair shop. I am excited to learn at Red Academy and to start a career as a web developer. I've been slowly but steadily learning about web development and programming in my spare time for nearly a year, and you can see some of the things I have worked on at my <a href="https://github.com/scottliv">github</a> account.</p>
			<h2>Things I'm interested in</h2>
			<p>The following is a list of things I like, in no particualr order</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Cartoons</li>
				<li>Riding Bicycles</li>
				<li>Camping</li>
				<li>Reading Books</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>A Photo of me</h2>
